# Effect Engine 2
A stylised full 3D engine designed to feel and play like a 2D raycaster, with 3D quality of life features.


## Currently Working On:
3D rotation with quaternions. At the current moment, the rotations are incorrect, the object appears skewed
or completely broken depending on the order of multiplication, which I still haven't worked out.

## Roadmap
The completion targets are my estimate of when I think I will have things done by.
There is no guarantee and they are likely to be inaccurate as I cannot predict my free time
or motivation to work on this engine.
